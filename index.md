## üñ• Projects

At Avid I participate in the development of [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools), collaborating in diverse areas of the project such as new edition features for post-production, expanding our UI framework (includind integration with Qt), code optimization for large sessions and the development of internal tools for code quality and testing;

In my previous position in the Embedded Team at Wallbox Chargers, I focused in the development of the services running in the chargers, as well as in the refactoring and migration of legacy components into a micro-services architecture. Additionally, I collaborated with the DevOps and QA Teams in improvements on the GitLab pipeline and other automations;

As part of the software engineering team at STT, my work was centered on the development of applications for motion capture, video processing and 3D scanning, as well as in the design of user interfaces for highly demanding desktop software and mobile applications. At CEIT I focused on the research and development of simulators, medical imaging software and training systems;

### üìÄ Most Recent Projects

_Projects under NDA are not listed here._

- [Cycling 2DMA (previously BikeFit by STT Systems)](https://www.stt-systems.com/motion-analysis/2d-optical-motion-capture/cycling-2dma/) is a high speed 2D motion capture application for bike fitting, that provides a quick analysis of the rider‚Äôs position and dynamic measures. I'm the project manager as well as the developer of user interface (built on Qt), camera acquisition library (PointGrey and IDS), video management (including our own variation of M-JPEG), data analysis and measurement tools. [C++11, Qt5, Boost, PointGrey SDK, OpenCV, XML]. STT, Spain. 2016-now;
- [iSen](https://www.stt-systems.com/motion-analysis/inertial-motion-capture/isen/). I've participated in the design and development of the capture workflow, several plug-ins for video-capture and motion analysis, and the sessions database of this motion analysis tool for STT's IMUs (Inertial Measurement Unit). [C++, Qt5, MFC, Boost, XML, OpenCV, internal libraries]. STT, Spain. 2014-now;
- Podia Scanner software. Podia is high resolution foot scanner. Podia software comprises all necessary tools to perform accurate measurements. For this, I developed the patients database (see MetaDatabaseUI), the 3D reconstruction module and the measurement tools. Regarding the user interface, I participated in its graphic and interaction design, as well as in its development. [C++11, Qt5, Boost, Eigen, XML, OpenGL 3, GLSL, internal libraries]. STT, Spain. 2013-now;
- Licentia is a licensing and encryption system to be used by several STT's products. [C++11, OpenSSL, Qt5, Boost, XML]. STT, Spain, 2014-now;

- ScanStudio is a scanning software suit that unifies different scanner drivers (using Scanner Central Station), post-processing tools and a common models database. It uses a plug-in architecture to allow maximum flexibility and provide developers with a common framework to reduce the development time and guarantee a great integration. ScanStudio is the environment upon which the software of STT's scanners is built. [C++11, Qt5, Boost, internal libraries]. STT, Spain. 2014-now;
- MeshProcessingLib is a library that provides high-level data structures and algorithms for point cloud and triangle mesh manipulation, including surface reconstruction, registration, filtering and reshaping. [C++, Boost, PCL, OpenMesh, Eigen]. STT, Spain. 2013-now;

At STT I've developed a reusable module for database of patients and their individual sessions (scans, motion capture), that can be embedded in any Qt or MFC application as an independent component. This module generates the UI and DB structure from a meta-data file. [C++11, Qt5, XML]. STT, Spain. 2013;
